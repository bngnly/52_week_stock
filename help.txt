7/9/2021:
thoughts-maybe make some preproccessing beforehand on things that are seemingly static, such as the stock tickers and thier
	respective yfinance info. those things dont change that often (marketcap) unless there is a major boom, but i think those 
	are ok to stray from for now. the goal currently is to convert the yfinance info on all the tickers to perhaps json format
	as a preprocessing step. this means that maybe you would only have to run this idea once a month??? 

workflow:
	generate json -> sort via market cap and threshold -> generate csv

running into a ton of issues dealing with json formatting, not sure if i suck or i suck but its not compiling like i thought it
	would. also realizing that the overhead is dealing with the yfinance api calls. in the end i am making the same amount of 
	api calls, so i dont think that i am making it any faster by storing things into json. if anything i may be taking more memory

6/17/2021: currently the script takes 11 min for the nasdaq and idk how long for the others, but maybe around 2 hours
